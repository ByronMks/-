specifically feature data science topic however definition still flux lecture chinese academy science beijing c f jeff wu suggested statistic renamed data science reasoned new name would help statistic shed inaccurate stereotype synonymous accounting limited describing data hayashi chikio argued data science new interdisciplinary concept three aspect data design collection analysis popular term process finding pattern datasets increasingly large included knowledge discovery data mining technologist thomas h davenport dj patil declared data scientist sexiest job st century catchphrase picked even majorcity newspaper like new york time boston globe decade later reaffirmed stating job demand ever employer modern conception data science independent discipline sometimes attributed william cleveland paper advocated expansion statistic beyond theory technical area would significantly change field warranted new name data science became widely used next year committee data science technology launched data science journal columbia university launched journal data science american statistical association section statistical learning data mining changed name section statistical learning data science reflecting ascendant popularity data science professional title data scientist attributed dj patil jeff hammerbacher though used national science board report longlived digital data collection enabling research education st century referred broadly key role managing digital data collection still consensus definition data science considered buzzword big data related marketing term data scientist responsible breaking big data usable information creating software algorithm help company organization determine optimal operation data science data analysis important discipline field data management analysis differ several key way field involve working data data science interdisciplinary field involves application statistical computational machine learning method extract insight data make prediction data analysis focused examination interpretation data identify pattern trend data analysis typically involves working smaller structured datasets answer specific question solve specific problem involve task data cleaning data visualization exploratory data analysis gain insight data develop hypothesis relationship variable data analyst typically use statistical method test hypothesis draw conclusion data example data analyst might analyze sale data identify trend customer behavior make recommendation marketing strategy data science hand complex iterative process involves working larger complex datasets often require advanced computational statistical method analyze data scientist often work unstructured data text image use machine learning algorithm build predictive model make datadriven decision addition statistical analysis data science often involves task data preprocessing feature engineering model selection instance data scientist might develop recommendation system ecommerce platform analyzing user behavior pattern using machine learning algorithm predict user preference data analysis focus extracting insight existing data data science go beyond incorporating development implementation predictive model make informed decision data scientist often responsible collecting cleaning data selecting appropriate analytical technique deploying model realworld scenario work intersection mathematics computer science domain expertise solve complex problem uncover hidden pattern large datasets despite difference data science data analysis closely related field often require similar skill set field require solid foundation statistic programming data visualization well ability communicate finding effectively technical nontechnical audience field benefit critical thinking domain knowledge understanding context nuance data essential accurate analysis modeling summary data analysis data science distinct yet interconnected discipline within broader field data management analysis data analysis focus extracting insight drawing conclusion structured data data science involves comprehensive approach combine statistical analysis computational method machine learning extract insight build predictive model drive datadriven decisionmaking field use data understand pattern make informed decision solve complex problem across various domain illustrated previous section substantially considerable difference data science data analysis statistic consequently like statistic grew independent field applied mathematics similarly data science emerged independent field gained traction recent year unique demand professional skill computerized data analysis skill exploded due increasing amount data emanating variety independent source whereas highly sought skill provided statistician lack high algorithmic writing skill make le preferred trained data scientist provide unique expertise skill nosql apache hadoop cloud computing platform use complex network paradigm shift seen various institution craft academic programme prepare skilled labor market institution offering degree programme data science include stanford university harvard university university oxford eth zurich meru university among many others cloud computing offer access large amount computational power storage big data volume information continually generated processed platform used handle complex resourceintensive analytical task distributed computing framework designed handle big data workload framework enable data scientist process analyze large datasets parallel reducing processing time data science involve collecting processing analyzing data often including personal sensitive information ethical concern include potential privacy violation bias perpetuation negative societal impact machine learning model amplify existing bias present training data leading discriminatory unfair outcome"
